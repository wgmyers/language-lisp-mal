# language-lisp-mal

An attempt to create simple syntax highlighting support in Atom for the Mal
programming language.

Mal is short for Make-A-Lisp, and can be found at https://github.com/kanaka/mal

I hope you find this package at least vaguely useful and apologise in advance
for any bugs or issues you may find. This is my first (and probably last) go at
writing a syntax highlighting package for Atom. Pull requests welcomed if you
have improvements / bugfixes etc.

Writing this was much less fun than implementing Mal was, that's for sure. By
several orders of magnitude.

## Issues

* Reader macros not yet supported.
* Probably a bunch of other stuff I haven't found yet.
* Sorry
